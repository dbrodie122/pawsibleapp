We need to:
1. Connect the DB to the MT
2. Factor out config details into appsettings.json
3. Download entity framework
4. implement database first creation of model objects
5. DOWNLOAD THE POWER TOOLS (?)
6. Add DB context to DI container
7. Inject the DB context to our controller 
(where does the logic live? If i make a DB querying object thath as methods that get shit off my DB tables, where does that object live?)
8. Write our queries to retrieve the needed data.
9. Write the route for getting pets
10. send the data back through the GET method for getting a pet.
11. From front end, add a call to the service/getPets endpoint.
12. Create a simple table component for recieving/displaying the data
13. Render the component on page load - should be responsive.
